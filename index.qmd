 <i>Cut through the hype one commit at a time.<br/>
   Intuitions. That's the game about.<br/>
   Neural nets are useful.  
   But only together with software and communication skills.<br/>
   AGI is cool. After six.  
   Before that, let's leverage data and computing power to build a better world.</i>

Hi there! 👋 I'm Fabrizio.

🎓 [PhD in Computational Neuroscience](https://fabridamicelli.github.io/research.html), now a 💻 Data Scientist in Hamburg (DE).
I work on fraud detection 🕵🏽 using neural networks and large datasets at one of the [largest e-commerce](https://www.otto.de/) platforms in Germany.

As an open source advocate, I have contributed to a few projects and also created a couple [Python packages](https://fabridamicelli.github.io/code.html) that I still maintain 🤓.
Beyond that, I am generally interested in topics around 🐍 Python, 🤖 Machine Learning, 📊 Data Science, 📉 Computational modeling, 🚀 Scientific computing and the application of data-driven solutions to make people's life better.

I prefer simple words and solid intuitions to unnecessary sophistication and fancy jargon – check out 📝 [my blog](https://fabridamicelli.github.io/posts.html) and 🎥 [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@fabridamicelli) covering Python/ML/Data Science topics.
