I finished my PhD in 2021 at the [Institute of Computational Neuroscience](https://www.uke.de/english/departments-institutes/institutes/computational-neuroscience/research/index.html) in Hamburg.

My PhD research was centered around two main topics:  

  - Modeling how connectivity patterns emerge in the brain from a graph theoretical, computational perspective.
  - The cross-talk between biological and artificial neural networks, i.e., brain inspired neural networks.
