 <i>Cut through the hype one commit at a time.<br/>
   Intuitions. That's the game about.<br/>
   Neural nets are useful.  
   But only together with software and communication skills.<br/>
   AGI is cool. After six.  
   Before that, let's leverage data and computing power to build a better world.</i>

Hi there! üëã I'm Fabrizio. Thanks for your visit!

Currently a Data Scientist based in Hamburg (Germany), working on ~real-time fraud detection with neural networks and large datasets at one of the largest [e-commerce platforms in Germany](https://www.otto.de/).

I finished my PhD in 2021 at the [Institute of Computational Neuroscience](https://www.uke.de/english/departments-institutes/institutes/computational-neuroscience/research/index.html) in Hamburg - see [research](https://fabridamicelli.github.io/research/) for details.
During that time I also created a couple of open source [Python packages](https://fabridamicelli.github.io/code/) that I still maintain.

I enjoy üìù [technical writing](https://fabridamicelli.github.io/posts/) and once in while make a üé• [video](https://www.youtube.com/@fabridamicelli) covering Python/ML/Data Science topics.

I like music a lot, Python, reading, simple ideas behind complex phenomena and data-driven solutions.
I prefer strong intuitions and simple words to unnecessary sophistication and fancy jargon.
