   Cut through the hype <br/>
   one commit at a time. <br/>
   Neural nets are cool. <br/>
   Software and communication skills rule. <br/>
   AGI is interesting. After 5pm. <br/>
   Before that, let's leverage data and computing power <br/>
   to build a better world.

Hi there! 👋  

I'm Fabrizio 🧉, [PhD in Computational Neuroscience](/research.html) 🎓, now a Data Scientist 💻 in Hamburg (Germany).
I work on fraud detection 🕵🏽 using neural networks and large datasets at [one of the top e-commerce](https://www.otto.de/) platforms in Europe.

As an open source advocate, I have contributed to a [few projects and created a couple of Python packages](/code.html) that I maintain 🤓.
Beyond that, I am generally interested in topics around 🐍 Python, 🤖 Machine Learning, 📊 Data Science, Computational modeling, 🚀 Scientific computing and the application of data-driven solutions to make people's life better.

I prefer simple words and solid intuitions to unnecessary sophistication and fancy jargon – check out 📝 [my blog](/blog.html) and 🎥 [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@fabridamicelli) covering Python/ML/Data Science topics.
